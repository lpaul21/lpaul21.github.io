        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Laura Paul. I'm currently a senior Computer Science major at Arkansas Tech 
        University in Russellville, Arkansas, but I am originally from Malvern, Arkansas. With encouragement
        from my aunts, sister, and dad who have had careers in programming and IT, I started seriously learning
        to code as a freshman in college, and I've learned a lot over the past few years from school, work, 
        internships, and projects.</p>
        <p> Through my courses, I have accrued experience in a variety of languages, frameworks, and platforms 
        listed below, and developed a more thorough understanding of the logic and structure of computers and 
        software design. In my work as a tutor, orientation leader, and youth development professional,
        I have taken on roles as a teacher and mentor, and learned how rewarding it
        is to share knowledge, advice, and an appreciation for learning with students and peers. These roles
        have also enhanced my communication and teamwork skills, and reinforced my grasp on the concepts I taught.
        An internship with the Arkansas GIS Office gave me experience working in an office setting, completing
        individual assignments and meeting with necessary coworkers to collect and share project requirements
        and plans. Collaborating on and leading group <a href="projects.html">projects</a> has refined my practical
        programming and project management skills while teaching me how to be adaptable and flexible to team
        and project needs and delegate tasks with consideration and efficiency.</p>
        
          </div>
      </div>
        <p>In this variety of work, classes, and projects, I have come to enjoy all the levels of programming, 
        from designing and creating front-end interfaces to building and managing back-end infrastructure. As
        I am completing my senior year, I'm looking forward to starting my career as soon as possible so I
        can apply what I have learned and continue building on my knowledge and expertise with people who
        can help me grow.</p>
