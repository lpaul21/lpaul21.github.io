          <p>I worked alongside my group members to develop Destination Dialect,
          a mobile application that provides a uniquely practical and customizable language
          learning experience to users.</p>

          <p>I led a team in an agile development environment to develop JELL, a mobile budgeting
          app for tracking expenses under customizable categories, planning and calculating savings
          and loans, and accessing current stock and asset price data. We built the front end in 
          React Native with JavaScript, and used MongoDB to host the back end database. I collaborated
          with another team member to design the UI on the Figma design tool, and delegated tasks to 
          team members using the Trello project management tool.</p><p> I wrote all of the back end models 
          and routes, as well as asynchronous functions in the front end to add, retrieve, update,
          and delete items stored in the database. I also implemented the UI of the log in/sign up screen, welcome screen,
          profile screen, and input expenses screen. Another team member added the pie chart to the
          overview screen that I set up, and another team member set up the progress bar for the goals
          screen that used the same format as the overview screen. On the calculation screen, I made the
          modal that allows the user to access current stock prices through an API, and the modal that
          allows the user to view their saved calculations.</p>
